# STEP 1: Planning

Chain of thought. Model is asked to think step by step, enabling self-correction.

There are four prompt sequences / steps involved in the planning phase:
- Find solutions 
- Review them
- Deep thought over solutions
- Rank results


# STEP 2: Make use of Memory
## Memory in LLM Prompting & Agents

**Sensory Memory:** This component captures immediate sensory inputs, triggering the model's processing. Ex.- A prompt

**Short-Term Memory:** Holds temporary information, maintaining context and coherence during interactions. Ex.- Recent Chat History

**Long-Term Memory:** Stores factual knowledge and procedural instructions, allowing agents to generate informed and relevant outputs. Ex.- Context from VectorDBs
